This is a fun, competitive, multiplayer, educational vocabulary game based on sound cues and definitions. Helps user to learn new words.


The degree of difficulty of each word is designated by a color code (green/orange/red). The player reads the definition and guesses the word answer based on starting sound given at each card.

The last definition has the "Beginning sounds" at the END of the word and the player has an OPTION to play this word or not (for this word only, 1 point is deducted for an incorrect answer)

The app included the following main features:
• 500 cards with 2000 definitions which user can play.
• A single game consists of 20 cards.
• There are 3 levels of difficulty in each card which allows inclusion of younger players as well as accommodating for differences in adult language proficiency.
• Cards definitions are based on "beginning sounds", not spelling (letters).
• Game can be played by single player or 2 or more players/groups.
